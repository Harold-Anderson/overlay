You are almost done!

  0. Setup a database (e.g. MySQL: see 
                       http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml)
    Alternatively, you can use postgres.

  1. Login on http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}
     and finish the installation.


  2. Move into the directory where you installed Joomla and remove
     the "installation" folder:

  # cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
  # rm -rf installation

  3. You can now launch your browser and point it to your Joomla site e.g.

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} -> Main Site
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/administrator -> Admin

  You can log into the administration view using the username 'admin' 
  along with the password that was generated or you chose during the
  web based installation.

  Enjoy Joomla!
